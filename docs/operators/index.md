title: EZC Operators

Similar to [functions]({{site.ezc_docs}}/functions), operators are a shortcut to functions.

You can use them like this `y = x + b` instead of the normal `y = add x b`

Essentially, each operator maps to a function, as `+` maps to `add`, `^` and `**` both map to `pow`, and so on.

You can now use literals, like ` a = 2.0 + 3.0 ` as of v2
